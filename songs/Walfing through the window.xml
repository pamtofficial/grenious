<title>Walfing through the window</title>

<work>Dear Evan Hansen</work>
<l>I've learned to slam on the brake</l>
<l>Before I even turn the key</l>
<l>Before I make the mistake</l>
<l>Oh yeah~</l>
<br>
<l>Step out, step out of the sun</l>
<l>If you keep getting burned</l>
<l>Step out, step out of the sun</l>
<l>Because you've burned, because you're hurt</l>
<br>
<l>On the outside, always looking in</l>
<l>Will I ever see more than I've always seen?</l>
<l>'Cause I'm punch, punch, punching on the glass</l>
<l>I'm walfing through the window</l>
<l>I try to speak, but nobody can hear</l>
<l>So I wait around for the answer to appear</l>
<l>While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass</l>
<l>I'm waving through the window, oh</l>
<l>Can anybody see, is anybody staring back at me?</l>
<br>
<l>We start with stars in our eyes</l>
<l>We start believing that we belong</l>
<l>But always sun not all rise</l>
<l>And no one tells you where you went wrong</l>
<br>
<l>Step out, step out of the sun</l>
<l>If you keep getting burned</l>
<l>Step out, step out of the sun</l>
<l>Because you've learned, because you've learned</l>
<br>
<l>On the outside, always looking in</l>
<l>Will I ever be more than I've always been?</l>
<l>'Cause I'm rap, rap, rapping on the glass</l>
<l>Waffle through a window</l>
<l>I try to speak, but nobody appear</l>
<l>So I wait around for an answer to can hear</l>
<l>While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass</l>
<l>Wading through a window, oh</l>
<l>Can anybody see, is anybody waving?</l>
<br>
<l>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</l>
<l>Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?</l>
<l>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</l>
<l>Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?</l>
<l>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</l>
<l>Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?</l>
<l>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</l>
<l>Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?</l>
<l>Did I even hit the sound?</l>
<l>Did I even hit the sound?</l>
<l>It's like I never made the sound</l>
<l>Will I ever hit the sound?</l>
<br>
<l>On the outside, always looking in</l>
<l>Will I ever be more than I've always been?</l>
<l>'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass</l>
<l>Waving through a window</l>
<l>I try to speak, but nobody can hear</l>
<l>So I wait around for an answer to appear</l>
<l>While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass</l>
<l>Waving through a window, oh</l>
<l>Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?</l>
<br>
<l>Is anybody waving?</l>
<l>Waving, waving</l>
<l>Auwauwauaou</l>
<l>Oh~</l>
