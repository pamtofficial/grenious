<l>That's paradise since the first time</l>
<l>I saw you standing there,</l>
<l>But it seems so long ago now, yeah.</l>
<br>
<l>That's paradise, but no map can</l>
<l>Show us how to get there.</l>
<l>Come on, oh, baby, planet of love.</l>
<br>
<l>We made our way out of long,</l>
<l>La-long darkness, and we've</l>
<l>Made it this far.</l>
<l>Such a long round, so let's go!</l>
<br>
<l>Shining all the way,</l>
<l>Oh, we're on our own path now.</l>
<l>We can take it anywhere</l>
<l>That we want to go, HOO HOO! </l>
<br>
<l><an>Sweet shart of love,<in>funny</in></an></l>
<l>Oh, can you hear it, too?</l>
<l>I am always looking at you,</l>
<l>My sweet girl.</l>
<br>
<l>And I see you right there,</l>
<l>Smiling back at me too! WAAAAAOOOOOOOO!</l>
