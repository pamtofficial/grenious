<l>Guess mine is not the first heart broken</l>
<l>My eyes are not the first to cry</l>
<l>I'm not the first to know</l>
<l>There's just no getting over you</l>
<br>
<l>You know I'm just a fool who's willing</l>
<l>To sit around and wait for you</l>
<l>But, baby, can't you see</l>
<l>There's nothing else for me to do?</l>
<l>I'm hopelessly devoted to you</l>
<br>
<l>But now there's nowhere to hide</l>
<l>Since you pushed my love aside</l>
<l>I~~~~~~~~~'m</l>
<l>Hopelessly devoted to you</l>

<l>Hold on till the end."</l>
<l>And that's what I intend to do</l>
<br>
<l>But now there's nowhere to hide</l>
