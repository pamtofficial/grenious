<l>Screw loose</l>
<l>That's what they say I've got</l>
<l>I'll be an astronaut</l>
<l>Or not</l>
<br>
<l>But hey!</l>
<l>What the fuck! Can I do~?</l>
<l>Baby, I've got a screw loose for you</l>
<br>
<l>Bonkers</l>
<l>That's what they're calling me</l>
<l>Not metaphorically</l>
<l>They mean truly insane</l>
<l>But they can't hear the voice in my brai-ai-ai-ain</l>
<l><i>(poop)</i></l>
<l>Giving orders to keep loving you</l>
<br>
<l>Eccentric</l>
<l><an>Erect (Oh yeah!)<in>One could interpret this as the screw loose girl becoming an astronaut and commanding herself to <b>erect</b> space statues. She may say "Oh yeah!" once they are finished.</in></an></l>
<an><l>Toys in the bathroom</l>
<l>Cards in the attic</l>
<in>Come on now, we've all done this.</in></an>
<l>But I just don't see the harm</l>
<l>In keeping my Sprite in your barn</l>
<br>
<l>(whispering)</l>
<l>(yelled) What do you mean they've confiscated my Sprite?!</l>

<l>Darling</l>
<l>It's so~</l>

The original line was "Hard to be 16 and schizo." The issue with this is that it's not funny to stigmatize mental disorders,
especially ones that are already stigmatized like schizophrenia. It is concerning how frequently (as of October 2024) the term
"schizo" is used.<br><br>
Here's an article I found that debunks common myths about schizophrenia: <br>

<l>But I know it's worth the cost</l>
<l>It's like drinking Sprite, which, I have lost</l>
<br>
<l>Screw loose</l>
<l>WHERE IS MY FUCKING SPRITE???</l>
<l><an>A panel of judges keep trying to take it away<in>The court is trying to TAKE AWAY the screw loose girl's sprite because they're ne'er-do-funny ASSHOLES</in></an></l>
<l>But until that day when they finally do~</l>
<br>
<l>(spoken) I have more stashes of Sprite</l>
<br>
<l>I am here if you need a loose screw</l>
