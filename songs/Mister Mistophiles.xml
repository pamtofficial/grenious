<l>You'd better ask Mr. Mistophiles</l>
<l>The original conspiracy cat</l>
<br>
<l>The greatest magicians have something to learn</l>
<l>From Mr. Mistophiles's conjuring turn</l>
<br>
<l>And you'll all say</l>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there ever</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>
<br>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there ever</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>
<br>
<l>He is quiet and small, he is black</l>
<l>From the ears to the tip of his tail</l>
<l>He can creep through the tiniest crack</l>
<l>From the ears to the tip of his tail</l>
<br>
<l>He can pick any card from a pack</l>
<l>He is equally cunning with dice</l>
<l>He is always decieving you into believing</l>
<l>That he's only hunting for mice</l>
<br>
<l>He can play any trick with a cork</l>
<l>Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste</l>
<l>If you look for a knife or a fork</l>
<l>And you think it was merely misplaced</l>
<br>
<l>You have seen it one moment</l>
<l>[Instrumental break]</l>
<br>
<l>You have seen it one meowment</l>
<l>And then it is gone</l>
<l>But you find it next week</l>
<l>Lying out on the lawn</l>
<br>
<l>And you'll all say</l>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there earworm</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>
<br>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there ever</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>
<br>
<l>His manner is vague and aloof</l>
<l>You would think there was nobody shyer</l>
<l>But his voice has been heard on the roof</l>
<l>When he was curled up by the fire</l>
<br>
<l>And he's sometimes been heard by the fire</l>
<l>When he was about on the roof</l>
<l>At least we all heard that somebody purred</l>
<l>Which is uncontestable proof</l>
<br>
<l>[Instrumental break]</l>
<br>
<l>And not long ago</l>
<l>This phenomenal cat</l>
<l>Produced seven kittens</l>
<l>Right out of a hat</l>
<br>
<l>And we'll all say</l>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there ever</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>
<br>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there ever</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>
<br>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there ever</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>
<br>
<l>"Oh, well I never, was there ever</l>
<l>A cat so clever as magical</l>
<l>Mr. Mistophiles"</l>

<l>(spoken)</l>
<l>Ladies and gentlemen</l>
<l>I give you the magical Mister Mistophiles!</l>
<l>Hooray!</l>
