<l>Oh where, oh where</l>
<l>Has my little dog gone</l>
<l>Oh where, oh where could she be?</l>
<l>Is he in the town</l>
<l>I am searching around</l>
<l>Perhaps in the bakery</l>
<br>
<l>Hello, Mr Baker</l>
<l>Have you seen my dog?</l>
<l><i>No.</i></l>
<l>OK Mr Baker, have a nice day!</l>
<l>What's that on the back of that frog?</l>
<br>
<l>A clue, a clue!</l>
<l>But it's in binary</l>
<l>I wonder what it could mean</l>
<l>Highs and lows, for ones and zeroes</l>
<l>What meanie has done this to me?</l>
<br>
<l>I'm going back home</l>
<l>I'm done for the day,</l>
<l>I've been brought down to my knees,</l>
<l>But HOPE is not lost</l>
<l>Because you, my friend,</l>
<l>Could have the secret key!</l>
<br>
<l>Little DOG, LITTLE DOG,</l>
<l>WHERE COULD YOU BE?</l>
<l>LITTLE DOG, LITTLE DOG,</l>
<l>I NEED TO PEE!!</l>
